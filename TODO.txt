To-Do's
=======

Issues
------

- indexing with the catalog doesn't work atm:  adding objects ttw seems to
  index them at first, but when the next object (e.g. another folder) is
  added the first one disappears from the catalog again;  the actual objects
  _do_ exist, but somehow don't get added to the catalog (or just temporarily)

.. - at the moment there are no known issues or bugs

Features
--------

- implementation of an index processor backend using the standard cmf
  catalog (done, but tests missing)

- monkey patch for adapterization of ``CMFCore.CMFCatalogAware`` and
  ``Archetypes.CatalogMultiplex`` in order to make the to be used indexing
  backend easily pluggable, so that queueing and/or dispatching becomes
  entirely configurable via zcml

- hook up these two to use the catalog processor as the indexing backend,
  but queue and optimize all operations

Miscellaneous
-------------

- creation of a PLIP targeted at Plone 3.2 regarding the above mentioned
  adapterization of ``CMFCore.CMFCatalogAware`` and
  ``Archetypes.CatalogMultiplex``;  the default configuration would then
  be to hook up the catalog processor directly, i.e. without queueing etc

- integrate more of the tests regarding transactions and threading from
  enfold.solr
